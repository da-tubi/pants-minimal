# Minimal template project for Python projects using Pants

This is a minimal template project using Pants:
+ No subproject
+ Only one fixed set of python dependencies
+ With IDE support

For demo project with multiple subprojects and dependencies sets, see [pants-pyspark](https://github.com/da-tubi/pants-pyspark).

## How to install Python
Please use apt or homebrew to install Python on Linux or macOS.

When the specific Python version is not available, you can always install Python via xmake:
```
xmake config --yes
xmake install python
```

## How to run?
```
pants run hello.py
```

## Dependency Management
In this template project, there is only one resolve (a set of python dependencies) called `python-default`.

And we add `pandas==2.0.0` as an example dependency in [BUILD.pants](BUILD.pants)

Do not forgot to generate the lockfile ([3rdparty/python/default.lock](3rdparty/python/default.lock)) for you own projects.
```
bin/lock
```

## VSCode/PyCharm Integration
```
pants export ::
```

The specific python version might be `3.10.1` or others.
```
Wrote virtualenv for the resolve 'python-default' (using Python 3.10.6) to dist/export/python/virtualenvs/python-default
```

Here is the Python interpreter generated by the above export command:
```
dist/export/python/virtualenvs/python-default/3.10.6/bin/python
```

For VSCode, a sample [.vscode/settings.json](.vscode/settings.json) with Python `3.10.6` is prepared for you.

For PyCharm, please click `PyCharm -> Preferences... -> Project: pants-minimal -> Python Interpreter` to add the existing `Virtualenv Environment` and then select it.
